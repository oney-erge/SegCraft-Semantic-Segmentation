# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [0.1.6] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- The README logo and demo GIF were broken on the PyPI project page because they used relative paths. They
  now use absolute URLs.
- The Changelog link in the package metadata pointed at a `master` branch that does not exist. It now points
  at `main`.

### Changed
- The package supports NumPy 2.x and OpenCV 5.0 (`numpy>=1.26,<3.0`, `opencv-python>=4.8,<5.1`), and
  `rich` was updated to 15. The lock file moves to NumPy 2.2.6, OpenCV 5.0.0.93, torchvision 0.29.0, and
  urllib3 2.8.0 (GHSA-8988-9cw3-xx77).
- The PyPI summary now matches the repository description.
- README: logo, badges, a short quick start, and a demo GIF reduced from 19.8 MB to 5.3 MB.
- The install and run lifecycle of the launchers was hardened, and launcher readiness handling improved.
- The release workflow can complete a tagged release again after a partial failure, uses Buildx for
  release attestations, and checks out the repository before creating the GitHub release.
- CI cancels superseded runs, caches pip, and runs with read-only repository permissions. Dependabot is
  configured with grouped updates.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- One-command native launchers for Windows, macOS, and Linux with diagnostics and repair modes.
- CPU-first Docker Compose deployment, optional NVIDIA device access, persistent outputs and model caches, and a health endpoint.
- CI coverage for launcher syntax and container startup.

### Changed
- The web launcher now waits for readiness before opening a browser.
- Tagged releases publish the Python package, GHCR image, distribution files, and GitHub release together.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- `segcraft doctor` now reports NumPy/OpenCV import failures such as `numpy.core.multiarray failed to import`.
- The web/video extras cap `opencv-python` below 4.12 to stay aligned with the NumPy 1.x runtime range.
- README install commands use `python -m pip` and avoid assuming the Windows `py` launcher is installed.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Web job stop button and cancel endpoint for downloads/prediction.
- Shared YouTube download cache keyed by URL and yt-dlp format selector.
- Fast/quality PASCAL video presets and quality Cityscapes/ADE20K SegFormer presets.
- Additional tests for download caching, cancellation, web job state, and packaged presets.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `segcraft doctor` runtime diagnostics for Python, installed package versions, Torch CUDA build, CUDA availability, and visible GPU names.
- Web app runtime endpoint and UI status line showing the active Torch/CUDA environment.
- `web` extra for installing the FastAPI UI, video helpers, Torch/TorchVision, and default Transformers backend in one command.

### Changed
- CUDA device failures now include Python executable, Torch version, CUDA build, visible device count, and CPU fallback guidance.
- Optional dependency ranges are capped for a calmer resolver result across NumPy, Pillow, Transformers, FastAPI, pytest, packaging, docutils, and rich.
- Missing optional dependency messages now use package install commands instead of editable checkout commands.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Packaged named presets for installed-package use.
- Web app preset dropdown with a custom preset path/name override.
- Additional presets for PASCAL video, ADE20K video, CPU demo video, and SMP Unet training.
- Optional FastAPI web app for video upload, YouTube input, progress, and output downloads.
- Prediction progress callback support.
- Optional-extra smoke CI and release publishing workflow.
- Real image prediction test using a dummy model when PyTorch is installed.
- Release metadata for PyPI packaging.
- Lightweight API notebook for config loading, model specs, and dataset pairing.
- Packaged CLI base config so `segcraft validate` works after wheel install.
- Direct video prediction that writes annotated overlay MP4 files from video input.
- Original-video copies and side-by-side comparison MP4 files for video prediction.
- Cityscapes video preset using SegFormer through the optional Transformers backend.
- Configurable overlay display controls for panels, region labels, confidence, percentages, and palette.
- Video sampling controls for first-N-seconds prediction and frame stride.
- Stabilized video label placement to reduce frame-to-frame jitter.
- Explicit floating-label toggle and concise GPU setup notes.
- Per-class confidence metadata in prediction overlays and `summary.json`.
- Minimal training controls for schedulers, AMP, checkpoint resume, early stopping, and JSON run summaries.

### Changed
- Config validation now treats `task.class_names` as display metadata so mismatched label lists do not block prediction experiments.
- Transformers prediction now uses model label metadata when available.
- README streamlined around install, CLI, notebooks, web app, presets, and release commands.
- Video examples now use a 16:9 prediction size to avoid square-frame distortion.
- Prediction overlays now use a vivid class palette by default.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Installable `segcraft` package scaffold under `src/segcraft`.
- Config system with schema validation and base/preset/local merging.
- Typed config sections through `load_config_object`.
- Dataset file discovery and image/mask pairing helpers.
- Optional model factories for TorchVision and segmentation-models-pytorch.
- Real image-folder prediction with mask and overlay outputs.
- Automatic overlay video writing for prediction outputs.
- Annotated prediction overlays with frame metadata and per-frame class summaries.
- Prediction `summary.json` with per-frame artifact paths and detected classes.
- Small video helpers for YouTube download, frame extraction, and verified video writing.
- Minimal supervised train/evaluate loops for paired image/mask datasets.
- CLI modes: `validate`, `train`, `evaluate`, `predict`.
- Workflow scaffolding with task-aware loss/metric defaults.
- Example notebook: `notebooks/01_quickstart.ipynb`.
- Tests for schema, merge semantics, and workflow summaries.
- CI workflow to run pytest.

### Changed
- README rewritten around package-first usage.
